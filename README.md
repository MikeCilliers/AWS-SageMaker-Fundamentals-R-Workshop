# SageMaker fundamentals for R users 

![](images/workshop_banner.PNG) 

---

The target group for this workshop are experienced R users with no prior Amazon SageMaker knowledge, who want to use their own (local) RStudio installation as an alternative to SageMaker Notebooks to connect to SageMaker to train, tune, evaluate, deploy and monitor machine learning models in the cloud. 

It is also for those who like to gain a solid understanding of the underlying SageMaker fundamentals, such as what happens behind the scenes when a training or tuning job is started. Moreover, we will show some recipes and best practices on how to parse and visualize the responses we will get from Amazon SageMaker in the different stages of the machine learning process. Attendees should have some basic familiarity with the AWS Console.
